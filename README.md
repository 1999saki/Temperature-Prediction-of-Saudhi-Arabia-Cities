## Installation

To use this project, you need to set up your environment. This typically involves installing Python and the necessary libraries. You can do this by following the instructions in the provided `requirements.txt` file. Use a package manager like `pip` to install the required dependencies.

## Usage

1. **Data Preparation**: Start by preparing your dataset. Ensure that it contains the necessary features and the target variable, which is the temperature you want to predict.

2. **Data Preprocessing**: Before applying machine learning models, preprocess the data. This may involve tasks such as converting percentage values to floats, creating dummy variables for categorical features, and splitting the data into training and testing sets.

3. **Modeling**: Select from a list of machine learning models provided in the project. Train and evaluate each model using various metrics like Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE), Mean Squared Error (MSE), and Mean Absolute Error (MAE).

4. **Ensemble Modeling**: Enhance predictions by implementing stacking regression. This involves combining the top-performing models to create an ensemble. Train and evaluate the stacking ensemble using the same metrics as the individual models.

5. **Visualization**: The project includes visualization components to display the performance metrics of each model using bar plots. These plots help you compare the effectiveness of different models.

6. **Prediction**: After training your models, you can use them to make temperature predictions for new data, helping you forecast temperatures in Saudi Arabian cities.

## Project Structure

The project's files and directories are organized as follows:

- `sd.csv`: This directory should contain your dataset.
- `Temperature_Prediction_of_Saudhi_Arabia.ipynb`: Here, you can find the full code and machine learning models used in the project.
- `README.md`: This file provides an overview of the project.

## Data

Your dataset should be placed in the `sd.csv` file. Ensure that it includes relevant features, such as temperature-related data, and the target variable (the temperatures you want to predict). The code will load and preprocess this data.

## Preprocessing

Data preprocessing is a critical step. It involves tasks like converting percentage values to floating-point numbers, creating dummy variables for categorical features, and splitting the data into training and testing sets. Ensure your dataset is prepared accordingly before proceeding with modeling.

## Modeling

Modeling involves selecting machine learning algorithms from a predefined list within the project. Each model is trained on the training data and evaluated using metrics like RMSE, MSE, and MAE. This step helps identify which models perform best for temperature prediction.

## Ensemble Modeling

To improve prediction accuracy, ensemble modeling techniques are employed. Stacking regression combines the strengths of multiple top-performing models. The stacking ensemble is trained and evaluated using the same metrics as individual models.

## Evaluation

Model performance is assessed using various metrics. RMSE (Root Mean Squared Error) measures the average error in temperature predictions, while MSE (Mean Squared Error) and MAE (Mean Absolute Error) provide additional insights into prediction accuracy. These metrics are used to compare the performance of different models and the stacking ensemble.

## Contributing

Contributions to the project are welcome. You can contribute by reporting issues, suggesting improvements, or adding new features. Please adhere to the project's guidelines and follow the standard code of conduct.
